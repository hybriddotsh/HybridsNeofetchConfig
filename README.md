my neofetch config 
the screenshot is an example with YsDark theme and a custom ascii logo I didnt include because I don't remember who made it so can't credit 

INSTALATION:
put the folder in /home/USERNAME/.config/

replace your current neofetch folder (I believe only exists if you've made changes to your neofetch configuration) 

install neofetch from https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch
